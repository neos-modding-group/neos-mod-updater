# Neos Mod Updater

An auto-updater for Neos VR mods.

This project is in a very early stage of development is *not* ready for use. It's not even a work-in-progress yet, as it's still mostly in the design phase. Check out the [design doc](docs/design-doc.md). There's a bit of code, but it's just simple proof-of-concept stuff to prove out the viability of doing certain things in Rust.
